## Q1: HTTP Path (Browser to HTML)

When you enter a URL in the browser, the browser first asks DNS to resolve the domain name to an IP address. Once it has the IP, the browser sends an HTTP request to that server. The server receives the request and responds by sending back the HTML (and other resources). The browser then renders the HTML to display the page.

## Q2: Docker vs GitHub Pages

Docker is a platform that runs applications inside containerized environments—lightweight, isolated runtimes that bundle an app with its dependencies and a slice of the OS. GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that serves pre-built files (HTML, CSS, JS) from a repository; it does not run containers or servers you control.

Docker containers are strictly required to run GitHub Pages.
